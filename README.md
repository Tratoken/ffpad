# FF Pad
I like playing games, so I use a gaming keyboard.
However, there are many keys on a keyboard that I don't need, so I made a small pad that lets me use only the keys I need.

It's a macro pad with 5*5 keys, so it's Five * Five Macro Pad, and I named it FF Pad.
By the way, I also play FINAL FANTASY XIV, and use it almost exclusively as a pad.
